# Simulation of Electrical Transients for Hardware Reliability Assessment

Simulation and analysis of electrical fast transients (EFT) and Surge immunity in power delivery systems based on IEC standards using LTspice.

## Overview

This project models and analyzes the impact of Electrical Fast Transients (EFT) and surge pulses on power systems through LTspice simulations, adhering to compliance standards such as IEC 61000-4-4 and IEC 61000-4-5. The objective is to evaluate the resilience of AC and DC system configurations under high-frequency electrical disturbances. Custom burst waveforms and surge conditions are applied to replicate real-world interference environments. Circuit behavior is observed and compared before and after transient injection. Additionally, suppression circuits were designed to mitigate these effects, guiding robust hardware design for noise-prone environments.
